    "The data we are using in this analysis is the Chordonomicon dataset which consists of data from 666,000 songs and their corresponding chord progressions. The dataset also contains additional information such as release date, decade, genre, and Spotify song and artist IDs. In our particular analysis, we are limiting our search to music by Taylor Swift, but the original dataset contains information from thousands of artists. The Chordonomicon dataset was collected by Spyridon Kantarelis, Konstantinos Thomas, Vassilis Lyberatos, Edmund Dervakos, and Giorgos Stamou from the Artificial Intelligence and Learning Systems Laboratory at the National Technical University of Athens, Greece. These researchers used web scraping to retrieve chord information from the Ultimate Guitar platform. They performed data engineering with the help of music experts to appropriately refine the chords. They also used the Spotify Web API to pull additional data regarding release date, genre, song ID, and artist ID.\n",

    "The researchers describe the importance of chord progressions as the \"backbone of musical composition\", and they saught to generate a large-scale dataset that can be used for advanced machine learning. They collected this data because they noted that chord progression, while vital to music composition, is a very underexplored area of research. There are limited datasets currently in existence as collectors are restricted by copyright laws, lack of audio availability, distribution, and bias. The datasets that do exist at this time are not large enough for the work that this team is interested in. Their solution, the Chordonomicon dataset, has more than twenty times the amout of chord progressions than the previous largest dataset. Now that the data has been collected by this team, the researchers performed experiments on chord prediction and decade and genre classification."
